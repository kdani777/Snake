### Welcome to Procrasti-snake!

Are you ready to waste hours of your precious time on a simple, yet exasperating game? 

Well you've come to the right place!

In this twist of the classic game snake, we have created 4 different ways to procrastinate.

First level **classic mode**:
use the arrow keys to move the snake around the screen to eat the apples. Avoid hitting the wall or trying to eat yourself.

Second level **color changing mode**:
use the arrow keys to move the snake. The snake, apple, and background will change color when the snake eats an apple.

Third level **rotten apples mode**:
use the arrow keys to move the snake to eat the apples. Do not eat the brown rotten apples. Avoid the wall and trying to eat yourself.

Fourth level **random snakes mode**:
Use the arrow keys to move the snake to eat the apples. Avoid trying to eat the dark green snakes. Avoid the wall and eating yourself.

*Enjoy!*
